# odin-project-recipes

The first practice for The Odin Project foundations course to become a developer. It is a simple webpage about a food recipes.

In this practice i made a simple menu with 3 of the most popular mexican food recipes. However the way i make it was very simple.

First i added The Odin Project Logo to make the homepage more familiar. used headings hierarchy and unordered list on the homepage for creating a simple view wich contains the name and an ilustrative image about the every meal menu that allows the user to select wich recipe want to open.

With every recipe i made, i divided 3 sections, description, ingredients and steps, and ordered with a ordered list or unordered list according to its content and an ilustrative image about the recipe for every meal.
